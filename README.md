# xFailOverCluster

The **xFailOverCluster** DSC modules contains **xCluster** and **xWaitForCluster** resources for creating and configuring failover clusters. 

## Contributing
Please check out common DSC Resources [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Kit/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).


## Resources

* **xCluster** ensures that a group of machines form a cluster.
* **xWaitForCluster** ensures that a node waits for a remote cluster is created.

### xCluster

* **Name**: Name of the cluster
* **StaticIPAddress**: Static IP Address of the cluster
* **DomainAdministratorCredential**: Credential used to create the cluster

### xClusterQuorum (Unreleased)

* **IsSingleInstance** Always set to `Yes` to prevent multiple quorum settings per cluster.
* **Type** Quorum type to use: *NodeMajority*, *NodeAndDiskMajority*, *NodeAndFileShareMajority*, *DiskOnly*, *CloudWitness*
* **Resource** The name of the disk or file share resource to use as witness. Is optional with *NodeMajority* type.  
* **ResourceKey** Only used for *CloudWitness* type. It is the full storage account key.

### xClusterDisk (Unreleased)

* **Number**: Number of the cluster disk
* **Ensure**: Define if the cluster disk should be added (Present) or removed (Absent)
* **Label**: The disk label inside the Failover Cluster

### xWaitForCluster

* **Name**: Name of the cluster to wait for
* **RetryIntervalSec**: Interval to check for cluster existence
* **RetryCount**: Maximum number of retries to check for cluster existance
* **Credential**: Credential used to join or leave domain

## Versions

### Unreleased

### 1.6.0.0

* xCluster: Fixed bug in which failure to create a new cluster would hang

### 1.5.0.0

* Added xClusterQuorum resource with options *NodeMajority*, *NodeAndDiskMajority*, *NodeAndFileShareMajority*, *DiskOnly*
* Currently does not implement cloudwitness for Windows 2016.
* Added xClusterDisk resource

### 1.2.0.0

* xCluster: Added -NoStorage switch to add-clusterNode. This prevents disks from being automatically added when joining a node to a cluster

### 1.1.0.0

* Removed requirement for CredSSP

### 1.0.0.0

* Initial release with the following resources:
    - xCluster and xWaitForCluster

## Examples

### Cluster example

In this example, we will create a failover cluster from two VMs. 
We will assume that a Domain Controller already exists, and that both VMs are already domain joined. 
Furthermore, the example assumes that your certificates are installed such that DSC can appropriately handle secrets such as the Domain Administrator Credential.
Finally, the xCluster module must also be installed on the VMs, as specified above.
For an example of an end to end scenario, check out the SQL HA Group blog post on the PowerShell Team Blog.
